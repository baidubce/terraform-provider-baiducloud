# baiducloud_security_group_rule

Provide a resource to create a security group rule.

~> **NOTE:** When a rule with the same combination of protocol, direction, port range, and either source/destination IP or source/destination group ID already exists in the security group, 
creating such a rule will update the existing one instead of adding a new entry.
This behavior is specific to the Terraform provider and ensures resource uniqueness. 
It may differ from how rules appear or behave when managed directly in the cloud providerâ€™s console.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "baiducloud_security_group" "default" {
  name = "my-sg"
  description = "default"
}

resource "baiducloud_security_group_rule" "default" {
  security_group_id = "${baiducloud_security_group.default.id}"
  remark            = "remark"
  protocol          = "udp"
  port_range        = "1-65523"
  direction         = "ingress"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `direction` - (Required, ForceNew) SecurityGroup rule's direction, support ingress/egress
* `security_group_id` - (Required, ForceNew) SecurityGroup rule's security group id
* `dest_group_id` - (Optional, ForceNew) SecurityGroup rule's destination group id, dest_group_id and dest_ip can not set in the same time
* `dest_ip` - (Optional, ForceNew) SecurityGroup rule's destination ip, dest_group_id and dest_ip can not set in the same time
* `ether_type` - (Optional, ForceNew) SecurityGroup rule's ether type, support IPv4/IPv6
* `port_range` - (Optional, ForceNew) SecurityGroup rule's port range, you can set single port like 80, or set a port range, like 1-65535, default 1-65535. If protocol is all, only support 1-65535
* `protocol` - (Optional, ForceNew) SecurityGroup rule's protocol, support tcp/udp/icmp/all, default all
* `remark` - (Optional, ForceNew) SecurityGroup rule's remark
* `source_group_id` - (Optional, ForceNew) SecurityGroup rule's source group id, source_group_id and source_ip can not set in the same time
* `source_ip` - (Optional, ForceNew) SecurityGroup rule's source ip, source_group_id and source_ip can not set in the same time
