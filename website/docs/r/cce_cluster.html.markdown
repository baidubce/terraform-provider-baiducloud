# baiducloud_cce_cluster

Use this resource to get information about a CCE Cluster.

~> **NOTE:** The terminate operation of cce does NOT take effect immediately，maybe takes for several minites.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "baiducloud_cce_cluster" "my-cluster" {
  cluster_name        = "test-cce-cluster"
  main_available_zone = "zoneA"
  container_net       = "172.16.0.0/16"
  deploy_mode		  = "BCC"
  master_config {
    instance_type     = "10"
    cpu               = 4
    memory            = 8
    image_type        = "common"
    logical_zone      = "zoneA"
    subnet_uuid       = baiducloud_subnet.defaultA.id
    security_group_id = baiducloud_security_group.defualt.id
    product_type      = "postpay"
    image_id          = data.baiducloud_images.default.images.0.id
  }
  worker_config {
    count = {
      "zoneA" : 2
    }
    instance_type = "10"
    cpu           = 1
    memory        = 2
    subnet_uuid = {
      "zoneA" : baiducloud_subnet.defaultA.id
      "zoneB" : baiducloud_subnet.defaultB.id
    }
    security_group_id = baiducloud_security_group.defualt.id
    product_type      = "postpay"
    image_id          = data.baiducloud_images.default.images.0.id
  }
}
