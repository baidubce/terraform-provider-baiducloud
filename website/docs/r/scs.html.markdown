# baiducloud_scs

Use this resource to get information about a SCS.

More information about SCS can be found in the [Developer Guide](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/SCS/index.html).

~> **NOTE:** The terminate operation of scs does NOT take effect immediatelyï¼Œmaybe takes for several minites.

## Example Usage

### Memcache
~> **NOTE:** Memcache currently does NOT support specifying `node_type`, set to `cache.n1.micro` directly.
```terraform
resource "baiducloud_scs" "default" {
	payment_timing = "Postpaid"
	instance_name = "terraform-memcache"
	engine = "memcache"
	port = 11211
	node_type = "cache.n1.micro"
	cluster_type = "defalut"
	shard_num = 2
}
```

### Redis
```terraform
resource "baiducloud_scs" "default" {
	payment_timing = "Postpaid"
	instance_name = "terraform-redis"
	port = 6379
	engine_version = "3.2"
	node_type = "cache.n1.micro"
	cluster_type = "master_slave"
	replication_num = 1
	shard_num = 1
}
```

### PegaDb
```terraform
resource "baiducloud_scs" "default" {
	payment_timing = "Prepaid"
	reservation_length = 2
	reservation_time_unit = "month"
	instance_name = "terraform-pegadb"
	purchase_count = 1
	engine = "PegaDB"
	node_type = "pega.g4s1.micro"
	cluster_type = "cluster"
	store_type = 3
	disk_flavor = 60
	port = 6379
	replication_num = 2
	shard_num = 1
	proxy_num = 2
	vpc_id = "vpc-ne32rahkaceu"
	subnets {
		subnet_id = "sbn-vhnqd71mivjq"
		zone_name = "cn-bj-d"
	}
	replication_info {
		availability_zone = "cn-bj-d"
		is_master         = 1
		subnet_id         = "sbn-vhnqd71mivjq"
	}
	replication_info {
		availability_zone = "cn-bj-d"
		is_master         = 0
		subnet_id         = "sbn-vhnqd71mivjq"
	}
}
```
