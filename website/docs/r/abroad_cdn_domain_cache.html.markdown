# baiducloud_abroad_cdn_domain_config_cache (Resource)

Use this resource to manage cache-related configuration of the abroad acceleration domain.

More information can be found in the [Developer Guide](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/CDN-ABROAD/s/Zkbstm0vg).

~> **NOTE:** Creating a resource will overwrite current cache-related configuration. Deleting a resource won't change current configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "baiducloud_abroad_cdn_domain" "default" {
  domain = "test.cdn.com"

  origin {
    backup = false
    type   = "IP"
    addr   = "1.2.3.4"
  }
  tags = {
    terraform = "terraform-test2"
  }
}

resource "baiducloud_abroad_cdn_domain_config_cache" "example" {
  domain = baiducloud_abroad_cdn_domain.default.domain
  cache_ttl {
    type   = "suffix"
    value  = ".png"
    ttl    = 36000
    weight = 30
  }
  cache_ttl {
    type   = "path"
    value  = "/to/my/file"
    ttl    = 1800
    weight = 5
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `domain` (String) Name of the abroad acceleration domain.

### Optional

- `cache_full_url` (Boolean) Whether caching of full url is enabled. Defaults to `true`
- `cache_ttl` (Block Set) Cache expiration rules of the abroad acceleration domain. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cache_ttl))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--cache_ttl"></a>
### Nested Schema for `cache_ttl`

Required:

- `ttl` (Number) Cache duration in seconds.
- `type` (String) Cache rule type. Valid values: `suffix`(file name suffix), `path`(directory in the url), `origin`(origin server rule. There is only one such rule, and only `weight` is required. Set `value` to `-`, `ttl` to `0`), `exactPath`(path is completely matched).
- `value` (String) Configuration rule for the specified type.

Optional:

- `override_origin` (Boolean) Whether to override the origin siteâ€™s caching rules. Defaults to `true`
- `weight` (Number) The origin server weight. Must be between `0` and `100`. Defaults to `0`. The higher the weight, the higher the priority. No effect when `type` is `code`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import baiducloud_abroad_cdn_domain_config_cache.example example1.domain.com
```
